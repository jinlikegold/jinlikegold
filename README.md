- 👋 Hi, I’m Jin (he/him). I recently completed an internship in front end web development with a local organization, working within the Squarespace CMS. I like to think that Squarespace was my quirky and unpredicatable colleague with a very different coding style, whose code I learned to collaborate with and modify with my own additions. :)
- 👀 Interested in web development from a multipotentialite perspective (with a background in design, entrepreneurship, and systems thinking)
- 🌱 Currently learning Javascript, debugging, and how to improve my overall skills as a front end web developer through Scrimba & other resources!
- 💞️ Next steps: I'm actively looking for junior FE developer positions, apprenticeships, and/or another paid internship. My hope is to continue learning and growing via  collaborating on functional, accessible, and delightful websites and applications, ideally for organizations with a social mission.
