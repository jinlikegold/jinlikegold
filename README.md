ðŸ‘‹ Hi, thanks for visiting! Iâ€™m Jin (he/him), creative entrepreneur turned frontend developer (background in design, social psych, and systems thinking). I've been self-studying for almost a year, and recently interned as a web developer with a local organization.
ðŸŒ± Currently learning React, Javascript, and how to improve my overall skills as a frontend developer through Scrimba.
ðŸ‘€  Next steps: I'm actively seeking junior FE developer positions, apprenticeships, and/or a paid internship. My hope is to continue learning and growing via  collaborating on functional, accessible, and delightful websites and applications, ideally for organizations with a social mission.
